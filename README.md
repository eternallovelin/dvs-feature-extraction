Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) data is an alternative to classical vision paradigms and offers many advantages over frame based processing. Further work is needed to create techniques capable of harnessing the full potential of DVS data. This repository holds some work using evolutionary algorithms to generate kernels specialised to DVS data. These kernels can then be used as low level feature detectors for input into neural networks.
